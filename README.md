# IDfy_DeepLearning
This repository consists of my work on the CIFAR-10 Dataset with Pytorch Framework for Image Classification using various interesting Deep Learning Architectures (Starting with LeNet and ResNet).
- I have previously worked with TensorFlow in my introductory coursework, but this was a thrilling experience because it challenged my intellect and really captured my interest in the Pytorch framework, hence I am motivated to explore this further.
- This has also been a nice opportunity for me to revise the Deep Learning and ML concepts that I am familiar with. Moreover, I also came across some interesting papers while making this project which I will definitely find time to read.

<h2>Following deliverables are provided through this project:-</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Python Model training (with and without Pruning) in a Jupyter Notebook, while also providing the model ".pth" files for future uses.</li> 
    <li><b>Trained Model Files</b> in the "./models/" folder ["modelLeNet.pth" , "modelResNet.pth"].</li>
    <li><b>Pruned Model Files</b> in the "./models" folder ["prunedLeNetModel.pth" , "prunedResNetModel.pth"].
    <li> A report ("./SummaryReport.pdf") summarizing the results, including the accuracy achieved by the original model, the pruning ratio chosen, the accuracy achieved by the pruned model, and the reduction in model size.
</ul>
