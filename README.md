# IDfy_DeepLearning
This repository consists of my work on the CIFAR-10 Dataset with Pytorch Framework for Image Classification using various interesting Deep Learning Architectures (Starting with LeNet and ResNet).
- I have previously worked with TensorFlow in my introductory coursework, but this was a thrilling experience because it challenged my intellect and really captured my interest in the Pytorch framework, hence I am motivated to explore this further.
- This has also been a nice opportunity for me to revise the Deep Learning and ML concepts that I am familiar with. Moreover, I also came across some interesting papers while making this project which I will definitely find time to read.
